<h1> MultiTwits </h1>

<h3> App </h3>
<p> At inception (God I love that film) of idea the app is a 'twitter-like' app that will allow multiple users to edit posts. If I can get that up and running then I'm only a hop, skip and jump away from a Quora-like app that'll allow multi-user edits or a storytelling app allowing multiple users to edit (useful for creative writing circles perhaps?) </p>

<p> To start off with I'll just look at getting a basic site up and running. Then I like the idea of creating a good user login function (with OAuth ideally) and individual posts. From there I'll look at extending it into a decent looking app where users can share posts with each other and invite other users to edit them. </p>

<h3> Purpose </h3>
<p> This app will hopefully teach me a lot about Python/Django in comparison to Ruby/Rails. I consider myself better in Python than in Ruby but certainly have more production experience with Rails.</p>

<p> It seems silly not to try to explore Django a bit more - along with getting more experience of working with version control and using Heroku/Amazon S3 to host the site. </p>
